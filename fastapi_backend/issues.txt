1. pytest /tests command run from /fastapi_backend failed with next error:
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'

    Project structure at that time:
    /fastapi_backend
        /src
            __init__.py
            /db
            models.py
        /tests
            conftest.py
            test_db.py

    Reason:
    https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/goodpractices.html
    Pytest determines the import name as follows:
    1 determine basedir: this is the first “upward” (towards the root) directory not containing an __init__.py
    2 perform sys.path.insert(0, basedir) to make the test module importable under the fully qualified import name.

    As result base dir was /tests (as the 1st dir without __init__.py). And base dir didn't know anything about /src.

    How to solve issue?
    1. add __init__.py to /tests directory.
    Is it the best fix?

    2. add project root dir (fastapi_backend) to sys.path somewhere before importing


2. For some strange reason TestClient().post could not write to db as db locked.
Committing session releases db resources (maybe)
See conftest.py::init_test_db, conftest.py::fake_app and test_create_user_endpoint::test_app
